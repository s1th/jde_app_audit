jde_app_audit
=============

Description:
This program will perform an application security audit of a JD Edwards
World system.  This program has two different run types: 'report' 
or 'diff'.  A 'report' run will produce an excel report showing who has
access to what critical functions (as defined in the conf file).  A 'diff'
run will track changes made between two different runs of the script.

Usage:
jdew.pl  [-dsn ODBC Data Source] [-u username] [-p password]
         [--run [report|diff]] [--before-dir c:\path\to\before_files]
         [--after-dir c:\\path\\to\\after_files] [--kill-chkpt] [-h]

--dsn         ODBC Data Source set up for this server. Required
              for a 'report' run.  This is the system that will be
              queried to obtain all the necessary data.

-u            Username to use to log into the system represented by
              the DSN parameter.

-p            Password to use to log into the system represented by
              the DSN parameter.

--run         The type of run the script should perform.
              This is ALWAYS a required parameter, and is either
              'report' for a normal report run or a 'diff' for a
              diff of two previous runs.

--before-dir  If running a 'diff' report this is the pre/before
              directory from a previous run.  This represents the
              beginning date for the comparison.

--after-dir   If running a 'diff' report this is the post/after
              directory from a previous run.  This represents the
              ending date for the comparison.

--kill-chkpt  Specify this option to have the script kill
              the checkpoint services.  Generally this
              should not be required, but may be at SMWE.

-h            Print this help.
